            <p> <b>OBLIQUE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</b><br>
            An oblique aerial photograph is made with the camera directed out and down at an angle from the aircraft (not straight
            out and not straight down).</p>
            <p> <b>VERTICAL AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</b><br>
            Vertical aerial photography is accomplished with the camera directed so it points directly downward. </p>
            <p><b>Low Altitude Oblique (between 1,000 - 1,500 feet)</b><br>
            This method is used to emphasize building profiles and offers the greatest amount of detail when the object or property
            of interest to be photographed is relatively small in size. This is typically the lowest we can fly in most residential
            and commercial townships.</p>
            <p><b>Medium Altitude Oblique (between 1,500 - 3,000 feet)</b><br>
            This vantage point captures a wider view than the low altitude oblique. Clients prefer medium altitude oblique's to
            emphasizing a site's proximity to retail or community centers, entertainment venues or restaurants, industrial parks,
            schools and medical facilities.</p>
            <p><b>Vertical Photography (1,000-10,000 feet)</b><br>
            This is shot with the camera facing directly downward. The advantage of this viewpoint is that the scale of all objects
            essentially stays constant. Measurements of directions are easier to calculate and visualize. Vertical photography
            disguises the relative height variations of buildings and landscape.</p>
